  "description": "Fixes #3555 Cannot set property 2011-06-15 of #<Object> which has only a getter in strict mode. When generating specific service, the script always generate extra STS client. Since STS client will already be included by Browserify through the browser credential classes, the extra STS client code is trying to re-assign a property that is already set, and without a setter property. This change prevents generating extra sts and cognitoidentity clients that already generated by browserify."
