  "description": "Fixed a bug that S3 client no longer honor the computeChecksums config introduced in #3799. Previously only the members with httpChecksumRequired trait will be disabled by unseting computeChecksums config. S3 doesn't not honor the config because it has its own logic handling MD5 chechsums."
